ANNUAL COMMUNITY SUPPORT PLAN

Campaign Overview:


Guidance for Voters:

Executive Introduction and Participation Guide:

The way Charity Compassion Coin for Super Representative, is running its campaign is in two ways of participation:

Charity Compassion Coin after being voted into SR Position and begins producing blocks will commence allocations of block rewards in the following coordination:


Participation Type 1. 

Freeze Voters:

Those whom casted top ten highest voting volumes will receive 50% of block production rewards in the form of Charity Compassion Coin (CCC) TRC10 tokens. Every Monday at 12AM UTC time the entire prior weeks worth of TRX SRC/SR rewards will be compiled, calculated and distributed out to all voters wallet addresses in the form of Charity Compassion Coin (CCC). All voters recieving CCC TRC10 tokens will recieve them in compounded volumes of whole numbers. CCC will always remain at a 1:1 ratio of CCC:TRX unless the TRON Foundation protocol changes its own rewards system based on the TRX valuation.

If one of top ten voters changes then the rewards will be divided accordingly also to the new voters.

The remaining 50% of block rewards will be allocated out towards the CCC TRON TVM DEVELOPERS FUND through our website ecosystem and to the United Nations programs needing humanitarian aid funds globally.
