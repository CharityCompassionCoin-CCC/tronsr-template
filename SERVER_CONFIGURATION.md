Plans for hardware expansion

All hardwares are Apple macintosh based Mac Pro's all with 7 teraflops of computing power and 12gb GDDR5 VRams, Thermal Cores, and 802.11ac wi-fi connection capabilities. Processing powers: 8 core 3.9ghz each.

(1) Internet network speeds are at the highest peak performance that is currently allowable through business internet speed buildout and access.

(2)Dual-system backup, which is a factor of stability and data security performance.

Expansion plans:

Multiple backup Apple Machintosh Mac Pro's for backup node runnings each with individual google cloud nodes built.


(3)In addition to verifying the node, multiple full nodes can also be provided, which can provide better API services to others.
According to above criteria, the content submitted by candidates will be scored appropriately, with a maximum score of 1 point.

Each individual hardware machine is running individual self sustaining cloud based nodes in house.


Server location:

Server buildout is located in Northampton, Massachusetts, United States, and in Huntington Massachusetts, United States.

Server types:

Xfinity based server provider for highest capably internet speed connections possible, and google cloud is host to node builds.
